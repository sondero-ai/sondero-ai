# Hey, I'm Sondero 👋

```
🧠 Human Creativity  +  🤖 AI Power  =  🚀 Ship Faster
```

I'm a developer who treats AI as my coding partner. Not replacing the craft — amplifying it.

## What I Build

**[CogitoDaily](https://cogitodaily.com)** — AI News & Tools Blog  
Next.js 15 • Tailwind CSS 4 • Automated with n8n + Gemini AI  
→ 5 articles/day, fully automated content pipeline

## How I Work

```javascript
const workflow = {
  think: "Define the problem clearly",
  prompt: "Let AI handle the heavy lifting", 
  refine: "Human judgment makes it great",
  ship: "Deploy fast, iterate faster"
};
```

I don't write every line manually. I orchestrate AI tools to build production-ready apps in days, not weeks.

**Tools in my arsenal:**
- **Code:** Next.js, TypeScript, React, Tailwind, Node.js
- **AI:** Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini
- **Deploy:** Vercel, GitHub Actions, n8n

## Philosophy

> *"The best developers aren't the ones who type the fastest.  
> They're the ones who think the clearest."*

AI handles syntax. I handle strategy.
